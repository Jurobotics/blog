Yesterday we were able to gain an exciting insight into the work of [INIT](https://www.initse.com/dede/home/). After our arrival, we were introduced to the areas in which INIT operates. In the following hour, we got a closer look at the development of board computers and ticket vending machines.

## Copilot

These board computers are installed in every public transport vehicle and record data to keep timetables as accurate as possible. What we found particularly impressive here was that these computers have to be built to withstand extreme environmental influences, such as volcanic dust.

Here you can see the unassembled board of such a board computer, which will later be assembled in an aluminum housing. This aluminum housing acts as a passive heat sink and was optimized for maximum thermal conductivity, because:

> Rule of thumb: 10 Â°C less doubles the lifetime of the device. ~Felix

## Ticket vending machines

We now had the opportunity to ask the team questions about the technology of a ticket vending machine. Everything was covered, from security mechanisms and the structure to the modular design of the components. We found it particularly exciting to see how the components communicate with each other.

## Getting to know each other

Afterwards we were invited up to the terrace of the INIT building to eat and present our current project. There we were able to show and share CAD models and ideas of our Cocktailmaker. More about that in the next blogpost. We had the opportunity to show what JuRobotics actually is and does. We also found it very interesting to talk with Cap, who regularly participates in the FRC (First Robotics Competition), about robotics and the different production methods of the components.

We would like to thank [INIT](https://www.initse.com/dede/home/) for the great day and the valuable insights!
