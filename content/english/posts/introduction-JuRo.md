# A quick introduction to JuRobotics

We are a young team of tech enthusiasts building a place to get in touch with the world of robotics and the topics that go with it. Our goal is to increase accessibility to robotics among young people and create a space where people can expand thier knowledge and discover new interests.

## Our Plan

For the goal of making the field of robotics more accessible, we want to participate in different competitions like the [FTC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc), [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) or  [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org/) and work on our own projects.

If we have aroused your interest or you would like to support us, please contact us.
